# wiggy

do you use WhenIsGood? do you wish it were slightly better? if so, boy do i have the hacky userscript for you! with wiggy, you can now:

-   easily toggle the inclusion of some/all responses in the calendar view
-   sort and search respondents
-   that's it

### installation

0. if you don't have one already, install a userscript extension. [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php) is the most popular and what this script was tested on, but firefox users may prefer greasemonkey or similar. other userscript extensions are probably available.
1. with tampermonkey installed, just visit https://github.com/thrilliams/wiggy/raw/main/wiggy.user.js and you will prompted to install the script. for other extensions, i have no idea
2. that's it! the script will run the next time you view the results of a WhenIsGood event
