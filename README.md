# wiggy

do you use WhenIsGood? do you wish it were slightly better? if so, boy do i have the hacky userscript for you! with wiggy, you can now:

-   easily toggle the inclusion of some/all responses in the calendar view
-   sort and search respondents
-   that's it

### installation

0. if you don't have one already, install a userscript extension. [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php) is the most popular and what this script was tested on, but firefox users may prefer greasemonkey or similar. other userscript extensions are probably available.
   - chrome users of tampermonkey will need to enable developer mode for any userscript to load, which can be done by following the instructions [on their website](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php#Q209).
2. with tampermonkey installed, just visit https://github.com/thrilliams/wiggy/raw/main/wiggy.user.js and you will prompted to install the script. for other extensions, i have no idea
3. that's it! the script will run the next time you view the results of a WhenIsGood event
